{% Insert summary of the paper here (used in introduction)
	This study assesses the capability of extended proper orthogonal decomposition (EPOD) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to reconstruct large-scale and very-large-scale motions (LSMs and VLSMs respectively) employing wall-shear-stress measurements in wall-bounded turbulent flows.
	Both techniques are used to reconstruct the instantaneous LSM evolution in the flow field as a combination of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes, employing a limited set of instantaneous wall-shear-stress measurements.
	Due to the dominance of nonlinear effects, only CNNs provide satisfying results.
	Being able to account for nonlinearities in the flow, CNNs are shown to perform significantly better than EPOD in terms of both instantaneous flow-field estimation and turbulent-statistics reconstruction.
	CNNs are able to provide a more effective reconstruction performance employing more POD modes at larger distances from the wall and employing lower wall-measurement resolutions.
	Furthermore, the capability of tackling nonlinear features of CNNs results in estimation capabilities that are weakly dependent on the distance from the wall.

	This study assesses the capability of extended proper orthogonal decomposition (EPOD) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to reconstruct large-scale and very-large-scale motions (LSMs and VLSMs respectively) employing wall-shear-stress measurements in wall-bounded turbulent flows.
	Both techniques are used to reconstruct the instantaneous LSM evolution in the flow field as a combination of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes, employing a limited set of instantaneous wall-shear-stress measurements.
	Due to the dominance of nonlinear effects, only CNNs provide satisfying results.
	Being able to account for nonlinearities in the flow, CNNs are shown to perform significantly better than EPOD in terms of both instantaneous flow-field estimation and turbulent-statistics reconstruction.
	CNNs are able to provide a more effective reconstruction performance employing more POD modes at larger distances from the wall and employing lower wall-measurement resolutions.
	Furthermore, the capability of tackling nonlinear features of CNNs results in estimation capabilities that are weakly dependent on the distance from the wall.
